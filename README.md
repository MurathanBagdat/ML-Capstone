# Machine Learning Capstone Dog Breed Classifier


## Project Goal

The Dog Breed Classifier is a multi-class classification problem that is a challenging task for humans. There are over a hundreds of dog species and some of these species have little physical differences. Aim of this project is to build machine-learning pipeline to predict given dogsâ€™ breed using supervised learning algorithms.
