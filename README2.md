# Machine Learning Capstone Dog Breed Classifier


## Project Goal

The Dog Breed Classifier is a multi-class classification problem that is a challenging task for humans. There are over a hundreds of dog species and some of these species have little physical differences. Aim of this project is to build machine-learning pipeline to predict given dogs’ breed using supervised learning algorithms.


## Implementation

Step 1: Import libraries.
Step 2: Get the data.
Step 3: Detect human faces using OpenCV’s classifier.
Step 4: Pre-trained VGG16 model is used to detect dog images.
Step 5: From scratch a CNN model is trained, validated and tested.
Step 6: CNN classifier created using transfer learning with RESNET101. More 60% accuracy is achieved.
Step 7: A pipeline is put together to predict correct dog breed if a dog is detected. If a human detected algorithm returns the resembling dog breed.
